# How to Use?

Download the source code from the repository and run the file just as any other Python script (.py) file.
```
python3 main.py
```
After you run the `main.py` you can start the timer.

# Description

The original technique has six steps:

* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
* Work on the task.
* End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5 minutes).
* If you have fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
* After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (traditionally 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
